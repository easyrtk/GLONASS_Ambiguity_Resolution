Abstract: A new integer-estimable GLONASS FDMA model will be studied and analyzed. The model is generally applicable and it shows a close resemblance with the well-known CDMA models. The analyses provide insights into the performance characteristics of the model and concern a variety of different ambiguity resolution critical applications. This will be done for geometry-free, geometry-fixed and several geometry-based formulations. Next to the analyses of the model's instantaneous ambiguity-resolved positioning and attitude determination capabilities, we show the ease with which the model can be combined with existing CDMA models. We thereby present the instantaneous ambiguity resolution performances of integrated L1 GPS+GLONASS, both for high-grade geodetic and mass-market receivers. We also consider the potential of the single-frequency combined model for mixed-receiver processing, particularly for the case the between-receiver GLONASS pseudorange data are biased. In all cases, the speed of successful ambiguity resolution is studied as well as the precision with which positioning is determined. Software routines for constructing the model are also provided.
